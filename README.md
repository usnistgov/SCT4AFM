# Supply Chain Traceability for Agri-Food Manufacturing

This repository contains information models and data sets developed by the
Engineering Laboratory's [Supply Chain Traceability for Agri-Food Manufacturing](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/supply-chain-traceability-agri-food-manufacturing) project and its partners.

A principal deliverable is a machine-readable semantic model of entities and tracking events to enable grain production traceability. This model will provide guidance to supply chain stakeholders in both understanding what data must be collected for traceability and in identifying gaps in relevant standards. Increasing traceability of grain products reduces risk for producers and enables safer food and feed by allowing rapid determination of the source and the scope of contaminated material.  This in turn increases trust and safety in the agri-food supply chain. 

Another class of deliverable of this project are synthetic data sets generated by simulation. These simulate information about traceability events in grain supply chains that can be used to test and evaluate the completeness and utility of traceability models and applications (such as for visualization).
